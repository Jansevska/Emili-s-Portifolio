                <div class="text-to-right">
                <p>Bourned and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil, moved to Maui, HI, twenty years ago. I come from a Christian family, 
                    it's comforting to know I'm God's daughter as well. My family is a mixing pot of different races, therefore 
                    when I don't have the choice of "multiracial" I pick the race with highest percentage. Played violin from the age 
                    of 9 until about 20 years old, when I moved to a coastal place in Brazil and my violin didn't like the humidity. 
                    I love the beach, the ocean and water sports. I've been living in an off-grid home since 2015, it's challendging but 
                    I've gotten used to it. I live with my boyfriend, our four fur babies, and recently brought my dad to live 
                    with us. I enjoy learning new things, and explore new opportunities as my background history shows. 
                    I love to travelling, enjoying the company of my many friends, and cherish quality time with my loved ones.</p>

                <p>I graduated from technical school in Printing Technology specializing in Graphic Arts and Pre-Press. 
                    Worked two years at Quebecor World Recife in Brazil. On Maui I've worked from Farmer's Market, 
                    to restaurant, to life insurance agent, to Lead Consultant at FedEx Office, to Banquet Server at
                     prestigious hotels like Four Seasons Resort Maui and The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua. Before the fire burnt
                    Lahaina town, I was working as a restaurant manager at Paia Fish Market on Front Street, Lahaina.</p>

                    <p>Surfing brought me to Hawaii, but paddling has become my passion since 2005. When we talk about paddling in Hawaii or any other polinesian 
                        island you can assume we are talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger_boat" target="_blank">Outrigger Canoe</a>. 
                        There are different categories: OC6, OC4, OC3, OC2 and OC1. OC6 is an Outrigger Canoe that fits six paddlers and 
                        OC1 is for a single paddler. Most of the competitions are for OC6 and OC1. I've competed in all categories, all over Hawaii 
                        and in Tahiti, Easter Island, and Brazil. Placed top 3 in every main event in those countries.</p>

                    <p>I grew up watching and helping my dad building cabinetry, closets, our beds, etc. Carpentry was my dad's main hobby. 
                        I just picked it up not too long ago as I had ideas and wanted to put them in practice. Thinking about it now, I must recognize 
                        Pinterest had something to do with it! As I like to check DIY projects most of them seems pretty easy to replicate. Since wood is 
                        very expensive in Hawaii, my diy carpentry projects are done with free used pallets.</p>

                <div class="text-to-right">
                <p>I had been thinking about a career change for a few years. Ideally, a remote work that I could 
                    work from anywhere. The fire that devastated the entirety of Lahaina town gave me all the reasons 
                    to search for an opportunity of a better and financially stable future while keeping my mind busy to keep 
                    depression away. A friend shared her experience going through a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp and landing her 
                    dream job. That encouraged me to follow the same path. Today here I am, it is all about new beginnings. 
                    Looking forward to start the boot camp that will give me the future I have been dreaming of.</p>
